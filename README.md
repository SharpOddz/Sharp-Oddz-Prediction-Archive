# Sharp-Oddz-Prediction-Archive

This database contains game predictions for every day that Sharp Oddz has run. There are multiple files for each day, each file for a given day represents a different models predictions. 

Each file contains two columns, the first one indicates the team name, while the second column represents the predicted score for that team. Games come in pairs, so the first two teams play each other and the next two play each other and so on. In general, the first team in the pair is away and the second team is home, however for collegiate sports this is not always true.
